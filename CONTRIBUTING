CONTRIBUTING
============

INBOUND LICENSE
---------------

Contributions are governed by the license that applies to relevant
specific file or by the license specified in the COPYING file, that
governs the license of its containing directory and its subdirectories.

Most of the Xen Project code is licensed under GPLv2, but a number of
directories are primarily licensed under different licenses.

Most notably:
 - tools/blktap2      : BSD-Modified
 - tools/libxc        : LGPL v2.1
 - tools/libxl        : LGPL v2.1
 - tools/xl           : LGPL v2.1
 - xen/include/public : MIT license

When creating new components and directories that contain a
significant amount of files that are licensed under licenses other
than GPLv2 or the license specified in the COPYING file, please
create a new COPYING file in that directory containing a copy of the
license text and a rationale for using a different license. This helps
ensure that the license of this new component/directory is maintained
consistently with the original intention.

When importing code from other upstream projects into this repository,
please create a README.source file in the directory the code is imported
to, listing the original source of the code. An example can be found at
m4/README.source

      by me, under the same open source license (unless I am

      in the file; or

  (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
      person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
