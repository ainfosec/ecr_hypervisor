Most files in this directory are covered by a BSD-3-Clause
license as stated in the text below, unless explicitly otherwise
stated.

New contributions to existing files in this directory are
governed by the license that applies to the relevant specific
file. New contributions to the files listed in [1] are to be
taken under a BSD-3-Clause license. We believe that most
(if not all) of the existing copyright holders intended
to make their contribution under BSD-3 even for the files
with no copyright headers. But this has not been verified.

New files are to be taken under BSD-3-Clause, unless otherwise
explicitly stated in the copyright header.

If you want to deal in this code you may do so under GPLv2,
at least.
