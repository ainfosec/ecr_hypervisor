Device passthrough
===================

Any device with the property "xen,passthrough" set will not be exposed to
DOM0 and therefore no driver will be loaded.

It is highly recommended to set this property on devices which are passed
through since many devices will not cope with being accessed by dom0 and
then handed over to another domain.
