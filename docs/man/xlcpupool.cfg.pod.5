=head1 NAME

xlcpupool.cfg - XL Cpupool Configuration File Syntax

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 /etc/xen/xlcpupool

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To create a Cpupool with xl requires the provision of a cpupool config
file.  Typically these live in `/etc/xen/CPUPOOL.cfg` where CPUPOOL is
the name of the cpupool.

=head1 SYNTAX

A cpupool config file consists of a series of C<KEY=VALUE> pairs.

A value C<VALUE> is one of:

=over 4

=item B<"STRING">

A string, surrounded by either single or double quotes.

=item B<NUMBER>

A number, in either decimal, octal (using a C<0> prefix) or
hexadecimal (using an C<0x> prefix).

=item B<[ VALUE, VALUE, ... ]>

A list of C<VALUES> of the above types. Lists are homogeneous and are
not nested.

=back

The semantics of each C<KEY> defines which form of C<VALUE> is required.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Mandatory Configuration Items

The following key is mandatory for any cpupool:

=over 4

=item B<name="NAME">

Specifies the name of the cpupool.  Names of cpupools existing on a
single host must be unique.

=back

=head2 Optional Configuration Items

The following options apply to guests of any type.

=over 4

=item B<sched="SCHED">

Specifies the scheduler which is used for the cpupool. Valid
values for C<SCHED> are:

=over 4

=item B<credit>

the credit scheduler

=item B<credit2>

the credit2 scheduler

=item B<rtds>

the RTDS scheduler

=back

The default scheduler is the one used for C<Pool-0> specified as
boot parameter of the hypervisor.

=item B<nodes="NODES">

Specifies the cpus of the NUMA-nodes given in C<NODES> (an integer or
a list of integers) to be member of the cpupool. The free cpus in the
specified nodes are allocated in the new cpupool.

=item B<cpus="CPU-LIST">

Specifies the cpus that will be member of the cpupool. All the specified
cpus must be free, or creation will fail. C<CPU-LIST> may be specified
as follows:

=over 4

=item ["2", "3", "5"]

means that cpus 2,3,5 will be member of the cpupool.

=item "0-3,5,^1"

means that cpus 0,2,3 and 5 will be member of the cpupool. A "node:" or
"nodes:" modifier can be used. E.g., "0,node:1,nodes:2-3,^10-13" means
that pcpus 0, plus all the cpus of NUMA nodes 1,2,3 with the exception
of cpus 10,11,12,13 will be memeber of the cpupool.

=back

If neither B<nodes> nor B<cpus> are specified only the first free cpu
found will be allocated in the new cpupool.
