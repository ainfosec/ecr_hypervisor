    This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
    contributed to the Xen project.  It is sorted by name and
    formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification by
    scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address
    (W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D), and
    snail-mail address (S).
    Thanks,

            Xen team
