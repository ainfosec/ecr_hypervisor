1. See README.xen_install for detailed guidance on installing the AIS customized version of Xen Project 4.10-unstable. Xen Project has been modified to accept a hypercall that can perform a VMWRITE that will modify the appropriate VMCS's so that the hypervisor performs a VM exit when the instruction is run.
2. See README.xen_vmexit for detailed guidance on toggling and measuring exiting behavior for specific instructions to conduct instruction timing introspection.
3. See README.libvmi for detailed guidance on installing and using libVMI for memory and cache timing introspection.
